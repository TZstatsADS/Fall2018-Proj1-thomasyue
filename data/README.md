# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

* the outsource data we are going to use is from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rit-public/HappyDB/master/happydb/data/demographic.csv

* If you have trouble loading the url, you can download the csv file directly from here.

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
